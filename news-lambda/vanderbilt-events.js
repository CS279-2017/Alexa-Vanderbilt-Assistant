Attend Curricular Practical Training (CPT) ;and/or Optional Practical Training (OPT) workshops and get the facts about how to apply for employment authorization. ---CPT is an academic experience which allows students to apply knowledge gained through coursework during their academic program in a work environment. ;  ---OPT is a 12-month employment authorization, related to a student&#x2019;s field of study, that can be used during or after academic studies are complete.  Did you know that it takes more than 90 days for an OPT application to be approved by the United States Customs and Immigration Services? Did you know that CPT employment counts all days including weekends, holidays, and travel outside the United States? These are examples of some of the information you will learn by attending one of the OPT or CPT workshops this fall. ; If you are an F-1 student, you have the option to apply for employment authorization to be used during or after your academic studies in the United States. ; CPT and OPT are only for students who have a declared major in a degree-seeking program (bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s, doctoral). ; If you have an interest to work off campus, please sign up for the Spring ;workshops. ;Attendance at a CPT and/or OPT workshop will now be required before applying for employment authorization. ;Spots are limited!
