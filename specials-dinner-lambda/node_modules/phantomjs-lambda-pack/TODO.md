## To Do
1. Move lambda-pack out of the example, and make a real module out of the deal.
1. Setup an simple deploy mechanism so I can prove out the deploy
1. Support versioning
1. Upgrade to Serverless 1.0
1. Get Local Integration working, in windows and mac
1. Get CI working, add coverage metrics
1. Publish

# Notes
When updating the main module, make sure to update the minor version number locally and run npm install update
Optionally, you could just adjust the example lambda to deploy the parent directory, to remove the NPM work internally.
