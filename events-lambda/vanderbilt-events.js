However, most studies have addressed hosts and parasites in isolation, and ignored the ecological communities in which hosts and parasites interact. This is a problem because species outside the direct host-parasite interaction may directly and indirectly affect host resistance as well as parasite infectivity, virulence and transmission. Monarch butterflies are commonly infected with a protozoan parasite, which reduces monarch survival and migratory ability. Monarch butterflies use milkweeds as their larval food plants, and certain species of milkweed can strongly reduce parasite virulence and transmission. Our studies have shown that butterflies can reduce parasite growth and virulence in their offspring by preferentially laying their eggs on medicinal food plants. However, our theoretical work also suggests that such behavioral medication can result in the evolution of increased parasite virulence by selecting for parasites that can overcome food plant-induced reductions in transmission. We are currently studying geographically separated monarch populations to investigate if the presence of toxic food plants, and the preferential use of these by monarchs, has driven the evolution of host resistance and parasite virulence on a world-wide scale. I will also discuss our population genetic and genomic work on monarch populations around the world, which has provided insights into worldwide dispersal and the genetics of seasonal migration.&nbsp;</p></div>",

As a result of participating in Bedside Matters we believe that caregivers will be better equipped to form meaningful, personal connections with patients and colleagues, and they will have greater insights into their own responses and feelings. ; Usually a panel of 4 or 5 people each present an aspect of the case from their point of view.  ;After the presentations by the panelists we will open it up to questions and comments from the audience.  ;Please be respectful of the comments expressed by others.  ;Be open-minded and fully present for the discussion.  ;Be honest and express whatever is on your mind. Listen to where others are coming from and what they are saying. Be willing to hear an opinion that is different from your own. And finally, what is said in the room, stays in the room. Maintain a focus on improving your own performance and that of the organization and the work of your team. ; "
